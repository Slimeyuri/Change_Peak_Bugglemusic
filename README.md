要改变音频的话，直接将音频文件拖进该文件夹中（BepInEx > plugins)即可，注意本mod只支持mp3,wav, ogg文件格式,需要注意的是由于游戏中只有4个源音效，所以只能放4首曲子，少于4个音频文件会导致有原版音效没有覆盖，多于4个音频文件会导致多出来的音乐没办法演奏，总的来说，最好保证该文件夹里只有4个音频文件。玩的开心~

To change the audio, simply drag the audio file into this folder（BepInEx > plugins). Please note that this mod only supports MP3, WAV, and OGG file formats.It should be noted that since there are only 4 source sound effects in the game, only 4 pieces of music can be played. If there are fewer than 4 audio files, some original sound effects will not be covered. If there are more than 4 audio files, the extra music will not be playable. In summary, it is best to ensure that there are only 4 audio files in this folder.Have fun~
